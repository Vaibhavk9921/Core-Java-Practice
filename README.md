# Java Programming Concepts Repository

## Overview
This repository is a comprehensive collection of **core and advanced Java programming concepts**, implemented with clarity and best practices.  
It is designed to serve as a **learning reference, revision guide, and interview-preparation resource** for students, fresh graduates, and working professionals.

Each module focuses on a specific Java concept with clean, structured examples that emphasize **readability, correctness, and real-world relevance**.

---

## Objectives
- Build a strong foundation in **Core Java**
- Understand **object-oriented principles** in depth
- Gain hands-on exposure to **Java Collections and I/O**
- Learn **multithreading, exception handling, and generics**
- Prepare for **technical interviews and enterprise-level development**

---
